        <h1>A Surprise Encounter While Hiking</h1>
        
        <p>One of my favorite activities to partake in is camping.  I love being outdoors in nature and surrounding myself with 
            the natural beauty of this wonderful planet.  One of the best places I have gone camping at was in 
            <span id ="sequoia">___________________________________</span>.  Camping among the big sequoia trees in the mountains was an amazing experience.</p>

        <p>Sequoia National Park has some of the most beautiful hiking trails I have ever been on. My last camping trip out 
            there was for an extended weekend, and I had planned on doing at least 3 different hikes to different parts of 
            the wilderness.  First day was an easy 3-4-mile roundtrip hike to this amazing outlook point, called Moro Rock, 
            that had spectacular views of the <span id = "mountain">____________________________</span>.  My second day hike was a little more 
            intense.  It was an all-day hike on the Lakes Trail.  It went up and down and around mountain sides, was about 18-20 miles 
            in total, but the view from the Watchtower and the seclusion of Heather Lake was worth it.  For my third and last hike, 
            I planned on taking it easy with a casual 2-mile roundtrip hike to a waterfall near the campground area called Tokopah Falls.  
            It was fairly level ground, so not as strenuous as the previous day's hikes.  It was on this hike that my surprise encounter 
            happened.</p>

        <p>The hike was going great at the beginning.  With all my sore muscles from previous day, it was a great way to just stretch 
            them out and get them moving.  I got a bit of a late start, so the sun was over head, and the trail wasn't as much in the 
            forest as previous hikes, but more along the base of Tokopah Valley.  Lots of rocks to one side, and small bushes and such in 
            the valley on the other.  The trail stayed along the mountain side in the direct sun, so it was quite a relief once I got to 
            the waterfall and able to cool off in the pool at its base.  The water in these waterfalls is from the snow caps melting in 
            the summer, so it was a nice refreshing temperature.</p>

        <p>While I sat at the edge of the water cooling off and having a little snack is when I heard a noise.  There is only one path to 
            get in, so it's the same path to get out.  I heard the rustling, and the low roar, turned around to look at my exit, only to 
            find a <span id = "bear">_______________________</span> blocking the path.  At this point they were just enjoying a snack of 
            their own from the berry bush they had found, but I wasn't sure how long before they decided they wanted something to wash it 
            down with and head over by me for a drink from the waterfall.</p>
            
        <p>I gathered up my belongs as quietly as I could to make sure I didn't forget anything when I had to make a run for it.  I climbed 
            atop a rock so I wasn't as easy to reach in case they took a jump at me, and waited it out.  It seemed like they were eating 
            berries for an hour, (it was more like 10 minutes), when someone coming up the trail startled them, and the bears retreated 
            into the bushes.  My new hiker friends were unaware that they were my saviors, but I was sure to warn them that the bear family 
            was nearby.  I grabbed my bag, and hightailed it out of there.</p>

        <p>Thinking I was in the clear, I slowed my pace a bit to catch my breath, since the sun was still beating down on me.  Of course, 
            at the exact spot I stopped to pull out my water to take a drink, was also the same spot that the baby cub bear was behind a 
            bush eating more berries.  I must have been about <span id ="feet">______</span> from it.  We made eye contact, I tried not to move, so not to scare the 
            little one, since who knows where the mama was.  It looked at me, I looked at it, we both did this sort of head tilt, (like 
            something out of a cartoon), and it went back to eating berries like it could care less I was there.  I decided it was time to go.  
            Sore muscles and direct sun didn't stop me from walking as fast as I could back to camp.</p>
            
        <p>Probably one of the most amazing yet scary experiences of my life!</p>
